# Backend Service

This directory is reserved for the future MongoDB/Express backend service.
Currently, the application runs with a frontend-only architecture using mocked data.

## Future Integration Plan
1. Initialize a Node.js/Express project here.
2. Connect to a MongoDB database.
3. Migrate the mock data from the frontend to the database.
4. Update the frontend API calls to point to this backend service.
