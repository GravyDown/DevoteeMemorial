# Memorial Site V2

This project is a frontend-first memorial and devotee platform.

## Directory Structure

- **frontend/**: The React + Vite application containing the UI and mocked data.
- **backend/**: Placeholder for the future MongoDB/Express backend.

## Getting Started

### Frontend

The frontend is built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI.

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm dev
   ```

### Backend

The backend is currently not active. All data is mocked in the frontend for development purposes.
Future backend implementation will reside in the `backend/` directory.
